This PlugIn for Ashita v4 displays a Recast Detours Navmesh in game.

## How to install:
1. Download the repository [here](https://github.com/xenonsmurf/Ashita-4-Plugins-and-Addons/archive/cf46b0f0dc5ac4840ee04133ba68499f6fd5cebc.zip)
2. Copy the **_Novo.dll_** file to your **_Ashita4/Plugins** folder

## How to enable it in-game:
1. In game type /load Novo
2. Click "Load Mesh" will load the mesh if file is found.
3. You can select, "Load Mesh on Zone" and it will load the mesh when you zone 
4. Mesh Render Distance - Please note for large zones it's best to keep this setting low < 100y
   if not you will drop fps. 
   
 ## Please Note 
 1. This Plugin looks for navmesh files in the following location: Ashita v4\config\NavMesh Files\
 2. All navmesh files must be in the following format zoneID.nav
 3. The smaller the tiles, the lower the FPS on Large zones.
 4. Transparency support, but note that it does not use depth.

 ## Recommendation
1. For the best performance, in-game use /fps 1 and make sure to use a D3D Proxy. - I've tested on both used in FFXI, with no issues.
